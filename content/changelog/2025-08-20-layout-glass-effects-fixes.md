# Layout and Glass Effects Improvements

**Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Version:** v0.2.1

## Overview
Major improvements to the layout system and glass effects throughout the UI, ensuring proper layering and visual consistency across all themes.

## Changes

### 🎨 Wallpaper Layer Architecture
- **Restructured app layout** to use a dedicated full-viewport wallpaper layer
- Wallpaper now sits at z-index 0 as the base layer
- MenuBar positioned above wallpaper layer to enable proper glass blur effects
- Desktop content area properly stacked without overlap

### 🪟 Glass Effects Refinement
- **Fixed menubar glass effects** - backdrop-filter now properly blurs the wallpaper beneath
- **Removed redundant backgrounds** from app sidebars (Finder, Settings)
- Eliminated double-blur visual artifacts in sidebars
- Sidebars now use transparent backgrounds to show window glass effect properly

### 🎨 Context Menu Theming
- **Applied theme variables** to context menus and dropdowns
- Replaced all hardcoded colors with theme-aware CSS variables
- Context menus now properly adapt to all 4 theme variants:
  - Glassmorphic Light/Dark
  - Oldschool Light/Dark
- Added proper glass blur effects to dropdown menus

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Restored "Change Wallpaper" option** in desktop context menu
- Fixed visual overlap between sidebars and content areas in apps
- Corrected z-index stacking throughout the application

## Technical Details

### Layout Structure
```
Root Container
├── Wallpaper Layer (z-index: 0)
└── Content Wrapper (z-index: 1)
    ├── MenuBar (z-index: 100)
    └── Desktop Area (flex: 1)
```

### Updated Components
- `/app/app.vue` - New layout structure with wallpaper layer
- `/app/components/os/Desktop.vue` - Removed wallpaper handling, restored context menu

## Impact
These changes significantly improve the visual consistency and polish of the Webintosh desktop environment, especially when using glassmorphic themes. The proper layering ensures that glass effects render correctly without visual artifacts or overlaps.
