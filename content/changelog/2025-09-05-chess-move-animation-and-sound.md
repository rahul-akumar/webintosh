# Chess: Move Animation and Sound

## ✨ What’s New
- **Movement animation**: Pieces now smoothly slide to their destination squares for better spatial continuity.
- **Placement sound**: A subtle click plays when a piece lands, improving tactile feedback.

## 🎮 UX Improvements
- Destination square’s piece is temporarily hidden during the move to avoid double-rendering.
- Undo is briefly disabled during the short animation to prevent state conflicts.
- AI delay remains, now complemented by the animation for a more natural cadence.

## 🛠️ Technical Notes
- Implemented an overlay "moving piece" inside the board, absolutely positioned and animated with CSS transitions.
- Calculated square size from the board element to align the overlay precisely with grid cells.
- Sound uses the Web Audio API (no additional assets required), plays at animation end or immediately if animation cannot start.

## 📂 Files Modified
- `app/components/apps/Chess/index.vue`
  - Added overlay moving piece, board ref, and animation helpers.
  - Hid destination piece during animation and coordinated state updates.
  - Added lightweight synthesized placement sound on move completion.
  - Minor style additions for `.moving-piece`, `.hide-piece`, and board positioning.

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Animate capture and special moves (castling, en passant) with distinct cues.
- Optional sound toggle and alternate SFX theme.
- Drag-to-move interaction (with highlight and snap) as an enhancement.
