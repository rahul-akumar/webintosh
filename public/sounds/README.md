## File Format Requirements

- **Format**: MP3 (for web compatibility)
- **Duration**: At least 1-2 minutes (will loop automatically)
- **Quality**: 128kbps or higher recommended
- **Size**: Keep under 10MB per file for fast loading

## Making Sounds Loop Seamlessly

For the best experience, sounds should loop without noticeable cuts:

1. Open in Audacity
2. Select last 1-2 seconds
3. Effect > Fade Out
4. Select first 1-2 seconds
5. Effect > Fade In
6. Export as MP3

## Quick Start with Generated Sounds

If you don't have audio files yet, the app will automatically fall back to generated sounds using Web Audio API. These work immediately but are less realistic than real recordings.

## Recommended Sounds to Start With

Priority files to add first:

1. `rain.mp3` - Most popular ambient sound
2. `waves.mp3` - Ocean waves are very relaxing
3. `whitenoise.mp3` - Classic noise
4. `forest.mp3` - Nature ambience
5. `cafe.mp3` - Productivity ambience

## Notes

- Files are loaded on-demand when you activate each sound
- Missing files will automatically use generated fallback sounds
- You can mix both real and generated sounds simultaneously
- All sounds loop automatically
